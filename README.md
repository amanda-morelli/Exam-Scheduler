# Exam-Scheduler

Collaborators: 

Ridam Loomba & Amanda Morelli

---------------------------------------

This is a project I recently made in Python in which one can create an exam schedule for multiple exams on any given day. 
The user may input the time, date, location, class size, course code and priority of the exam. This program recognizes over-loaded exams, 
in which three consucutive exams are scehduled. It also recognizes overlap and suggests alternate to recitfy contingencies. 

There is also the option to provide a student with a specific schedule based on their classes taken. Ideal for course c0ordinators 
trying to plan out their examination plans, this was created for fun to explore the use of graphical user interfaces 
and to better understand global variabes. 

To use this program, simply run the GUI file, and have fun inputing a scehdule!
